    <p>An alleycat is a choose-your-own-adventure ride inspired by bike couriers.

        It's the most fun you can have on a bike! Basically a scavenger hunt via bike!</p>

    <p>You get a list of stops, plan your route, & hit as many as you want before the cutoff/cookout.

        Ride solo or party-pace with a group. Your call!</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center; font-family: HWTArtz;">Alleycat Design</h2>
    <p>This alleycat is Beginner-friendly by design!There are a near infinite number of stops, so you decide which and
        how many you'd like to hit based on where and
        how far you want to ride.

        There are over a dozen in the Meredith/NCSU/Wade/Downtown boundary area alone.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center; font-family: HWTArtz;">Drawing Contest</h2>
    <p>Speed doesn't matter! Creativity does!

        Each stop you make earns you a random crayon to color in the drawing. best ones win!</p>

    <p>If you're a Speedster or veteran townie, there will be a few bonus prizes for hitting the most stops and the
        farthest away stop reached.</p>

    <p>Join us for an alleycat & cookout! New to alleycats? Alleycats are fun, choose-your-own-adventure rides
        inspired by bike couriers. You'll get a list of stops, plan a route, and hit as many stops as you can (or
        want to) before the cutoff. Each stop earns you a random crayon. At the end, use them to color in a drawing.
        Best ones win prizes!</p>

    <p>Ride solo or party-pace with a group. Perfect for beginners, newcomers, veteran townies, and everyone in
        between. Featuring a post-ride cookout with hot dogs (veggie and meat), drinks, and snacks. Proceeds go to
        <strong>Raleigh Community Kickstand</strong>, a collective providing free repairs, bikes, and training for
        folks in need. See you there!
